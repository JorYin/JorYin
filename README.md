Hey, I am Jordan, a 2nd year student pursuing computer science at Boston University!

I am interested in software engineering, web development, mobile apps, and game development! I have a relentless passion for acquiring new skills and a genuine love for tackling challenges head-on.

Outside of coding, you'll find me at the gym, sketching ideas, enjoying time with friends, or filming videos!
